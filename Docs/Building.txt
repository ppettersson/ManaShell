This program depends on wxWidgets. It should work with the latest version, but
to minimize compatibility problems you can get the version that was used for
development here:

	git clone https://github.com/ppettersson/wxWidgets.git
	cd wxWidgets
	git checkout ppettersson.0

That branch has some minor fixes to the project file when using Visual Studio
but is otherwise unmodified.


* Linux

	mkdir build-debug ; cd build-debug ; ../configure --enable-debug --with-gtk --enable-unicode --disable-shared ; make -j8 ; cd ..
	mkdir build-release ; cd build-release ; ../configure --with-gtk --enable-unicode --disable-shared ; make -j8 ; cd ..
	export WXWIDGETS=/full/path/to/wxWidgets

	cd ManaShell/Build/gcc
	make -j8


* Windows (VS2013)

	Open wxWidgets/build/msw/wx_vc10.sln and build the combinations you'll use:
		Debug|Release, Win32|x64

	Set the following environment variable:
		WXWIDGETS	c:\full\path\to\wxWidgets

	Restart Visual Studio for it to pick up the new environment variable.

	Open ManaShell/Build/VS2013/ManaShell.sln and build.
