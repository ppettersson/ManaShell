=== Wishlist for Future versions ===

- Tools:
	- logcat viewer with filters.
	- debug image viewer (wxImageView).
- Plugins:
	- gdb/mi
	- lldb
	- make: http://www.cmcrossroads.com/article/interactive-gnu-make-debugger
	- bash: http://bashdb.sourceforge.net


=== Known Bugs ===

- Text input stream in piped process assumes the output from the inferior
  process is unicode when it's really ascii. Investigate if it's our bug,
  a wx bug or maybe a Windows bug.
- Crash on shutdown if a process is running.
